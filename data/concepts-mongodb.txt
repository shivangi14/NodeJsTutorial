*NoSQL databases / non-relational databases
-schemaless
-no relationships in db
-types
    Key-value stores (Redis, think hash tables)
    Document stores (mongoDB, think JSON)
    Columnar stores (hbase, average age)
    Graphs stores (neo4j)

*MongoDB
-javascript-like language for interface
-Availability and Partition tolerance from CAP (C - consistency)
-Document store NoSQL db (JSON like)
-REPL is sync, accessing with Mongoclient is asynchronous
-Hence with mongoclient we have callbacks
-callback - (error,data)
